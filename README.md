# AI-Assisted Structural Analysis & Cross-Domain Framework Engineering

### Project Overview
This repository contains a 3-month iterative R&D project focused on aligning an LLM (ChatGPT) to a complex mathematical and sociological framework. 

**Core achievement:** Developing a universal "Network Operator" questionnaire that identifies structural invariants across diverse domains: Fashion Theory -> Fine Arts -> Social Institutions.

### Methodology
- **Domain:** Topology of Social Systems (PhD-level Research).
- **Technique:** Recursive Prompt Engineering & Chain-of-Thought Steering.
- **Goal:** Extracting "non-dictionary" meanings where the configuration of connections defines the system's agency.

### Navigation (Selected Logs)
*Note: Logs are in Russian to preserve linguistic nuances, but the structural logic is universal.*
- [Link to Log 01] - **Extraction:** Creating the formal questionnaire from fashion theory.
- [Link to Log 15] - **Invariance Test:** Applying the fashion framework to painting styles.
- [Link to Log 30] - **Scaling:** Institutional analysis (Law & Military) as information processors.
